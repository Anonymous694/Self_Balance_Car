# Self_Balance_Car
The project is to gain a better understanding of modern control theory. We used MPU6050 (gyroscope + accelerometer, which gives both acceleration and rotation in all three axes), Arduino Mega 2560, portable charger and L298N motor control module. We  modeled mathematically in Matlab to estimate the proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the PID controller, and by calibrating the MPU6050 and fine-tuning the three PID parameters, we balanced the trolley to achieve dynamic balancing in the vertical direction that is resistant to external disturbances. In the same way we build the LQR module of our trolley in matlab, which can precisely control each state quantity separately.
